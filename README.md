# React + Vite
# Hobby_Hub

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Welcome to Hobby_Hub! A modern web application designed to be a central place for users to discover, share, and engage with their hobbies.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
## üöÄ Features

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React and Vite for a fast and responsive user experience.
- **Engaging Animations**: Utilizes libraries like `react-awesome-reveal` and `lottie-web` to create a dynamic and engaging interface.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Integrated `react-toastify` for user-friendly notifications.
- **AI-Powered**: Leverages Firebase's AI capabilities to provide smart features.
- **Robust Backend**: Powered by Firebase for reliable and scalable services.

## React Compiler
## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).
- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Vite
  - React Awesome Reveal for animations.
  - React Toastify for notifications.
  - Lottie-web for animations.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration
- **Backend & Services**:
  - Firebase
  - Firebase AI

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
